;;; Commentary:
;; A fully fledged, reproducible Emacs configuration

;;; Code:

;; Inidcator to show content inside an org heading
(setq org-ellipsis " â¤µ")
;; Indent according to nesting level
(setq org-startup-indented t)
;; Only show one heading marker
(setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
;; Fold all headings on startup
(setq org-startup-folded t)
;; Protects against editing internals of closed org-headings
(setq org-catch-invisible-edits t)

;; Always do indentation
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-indent-mode)
;; Always use bullets 
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))

;; Allows for simple elisp code blocks using "<el" + TAB
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
             '("el" . "src emacs-lisp"))

;; Always add a timestamp when a file is saved
(setq time-stamp-active t)
(setq time-stamp-start "#\\+last_modified:[ \t]")
(setq time-stamp-end "$")
(setq time-stamp-format "\[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M\]")
